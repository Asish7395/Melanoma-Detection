# Project Name
> Melanoma Detection


<!-- You can include any other section that is pertinent to your problem -->

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
	We are looking at various appraches in building a model to detect and identify melanoma from medical images.
- What is the dataset that is being used?
	Skin cancer ISIC The International Skin Imaging Collaboration

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- We infer that the training and test accuracy increase with the increase in depth of the neural network.
- We infer that the model performs better with data augmentation to increase and maintain a class balance.


## Technologies Used
tensorflow
keras
